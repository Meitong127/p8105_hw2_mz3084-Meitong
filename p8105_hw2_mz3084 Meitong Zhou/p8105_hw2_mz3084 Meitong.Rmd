## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

Import the data frame
```{r}
nyc_transit_df= read_csv("Meitong's data/NYC_Transit.csv", na = c("NA", "", "."))
nyc_transit_df = janitor::clean_names(nyc_transit_df)
```
Select the variables

```{r}
select(nyc_transit_df, line:station_latitude,route1:route11,vending,entrance_type,entry,ada)
relocate(nyc_transit_df,line, entry)|>
  mutate(nyc_transit_df, entry = case_when(
    entry == "YES" ~ TRUE,
    entry == "NO" ~ FALSE
))
nyc_transit_df
```

The cleaned dataset has 1,868 rows and 12 columns. the variables include line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. These data are tidy, meaning each variable is in its column, and each row represents a distinct subway entrance.

**How many distinct stations are there?**

```{r}
distinct_stations_df = distinct(nyc_transit_df,line, station_name)
distinct_stations_df
```

```{r}
distinct_stations_count = nrow(distinct_stations_df)

# Display the count of distinct stations
distinct_stations_count
```

**How many stations are ADA compliant?**

```{r}
ada_comp_sta = nyc_transit_df|>
  filter(ada == TRUE) |>
  distinct(line, station_name) |>
  count()
ada_comp_sta
```
**What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?**
```{r}
no_vending_proportion = nyc_transit_df |>
  filter(vending == FALSE) |>
  summarise(proportion = n() / nrow(nyc_transit_df))
no_vending_proportion
```

## Problem 2
```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
mr_trash_wheel= read_xlsx("Meitong's data/trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet="Mr. Trash Wheel", skip=1,na = c(".", "NA", ""), col_names = TRUE)
mr_trash_wheel= 
    janitor::clean_names(mr_trash_wheel) # clean the data into reasonable var name.
drop_na(mr_trash_wheel) # drop rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
mr_trash_wheel= mr_trash_wheel|>
  mutate(sport_balls= as.integer(round(sports_balls, 0)))
mr_trash_wheel= mr_trash_wheel|>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Mr. Trash Wheel")
```
```{r}
# upload other two sheets and clean them
prof_trash_wheel = read_xlsx("Meitong's data/trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", skip = 1)
prof_trash_wheel= 
    janitor::clean_names(prof_trash_wheel)
drop_na(prof_trash_wheel)
prof_trash_wheel= prof_trash_wheel|>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Professor Trash Wheel")
gwynnda_trash_wheel = read_xlsx("Meitong's data/trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", skip = 1)
gwynnda_trash_wheel= 
    janitor::clean_names(gwynnda_trash_wheel)
drop_na(gwynnda_trash_wheel)
gwynnda_trash_wheel= gwynnda_trash_wheel|>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel")
```
```{r}
#change all variable "Year" into numeric factor
mr_trash_wheel = mr_trash_wheel |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
prof_trash_wheel = prof_trash_wheel |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
gwynnda_trash_wheel = gwynnda_trash_wheel |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
# combine 3 data set
all_trash_wheel= bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel, gwynnda_trash_wheel)
all_trash_wheel
```
```{r}
nrow(all_trash_wheel) 
```

```{r}
total_sum_prof = prof_trash_wheel |>
  summarise(weight_total = sum(weight_tons, na.rm = TRUE))
total_sum_prof
total_sum_gwynnda_cig_butts = gwynnda_trash_wheel |>
  summarise(cig_butts_total = sum(cigarette_butts, na.rm = TRUE))
total_sum_gwynnda_cig_butts
```


After cleaning and merging the data, the resulting dataset contains `rnrow(all_trash_wheel)`  observations. Professor Trash Wheel collected a total of `rtotal_sum_prof` tons of trash. In June 2022, Gwynnda Trash Wheel collected `rtotal_sum_gwynnda_cig_butts` cigarette butts.

## Problem 3

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
# read all of the table ans clean there variables' name
bakes_df = read_csv("gbb_datasets/bakes.csv")
bakes_df= 
    janitor::clean_names(bakes_df)
bakers_df = read_csv("gbb_datasets/bakers.csv")
bakers_df= 
    janitor::clean_names(bakers_df)
bakers_df = bakers_df|>
  rename(baker = baker_name)
results_df = read_csv("gbb_datasets/results.csv", skip = 2)
results_df= 
    janitor::clean_names(results_df)
results_df = select(results_df,series, episode, baker, technical, result)
viewers_df = read_csv("gbb_datasets/viewers.csv")
viewers_df= 
    janitor::clean_names(viewers_df)
```

```{r}
#check if there is any non-matched variable
anti_join(bakes_df, bakers_df, by = c("series", "baker"))
anti_join(bakes_df, results_df, by = c("series", "episode", "baker"))
```
```{r}
# combine two tables
merged_data = left_join(bakes_df, bakers_df, by = c("series", "baker"))
final_data = left_join(merged_data, results_df, by = c("series", "episode", "baker"))
# download the new table
write_csv(final_data, "gbb_datasets/final_gbbo_dataset.csv")
```

```{r}
# build a new column
final_data = final_data |>
  mutate(star_baker_winner = ifelse(result == "STAR BAKER" | result == "WINNER", TRUE, FALSE))
# get the star baker and winner from series 5 to series 10
season_5_to_10 = final_data |>
  filter(series >= 5 & series <= 10 & star_baker_winner == TRUE)
star_baker_winner = season_5_to_10 |>
  select(series, episode, baker, result)
# download the table
print(star_baker_winner)
write_csv(star_baker_winner, "gbb_datasets/star_baker_winner_dataset.csv")
```


```{r}
head(viewers_df, 10)
```
```{r}
mean_series_1 <- viewers_df |> 
  pull(series_1) |> 
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)
mean_series_5 <- viewers_df |> 
  pull(series_5) |> 
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)
mean_series_1
mean_series_5
```

I read the Excel data sheet for each garbage round using read_excel() and skipped unnecessary rows using the skip parameter. In addition, I used the janitor::clean_names() function to convert all column names to a more readable form (e.g., "Weight (tons)" to weight_tons). After checking for mismatched variables using anti_join, I joined the three tables together using left_join. Problems encountered: In the dataset, some observations may be missing. We used na.rm = TRUE to ignore these missing values when calculating the totals. For the viewers data frame, the mean value of series 1 is `rmean_series_1`, and the mean value of series 5 is `rmean_series_5`
